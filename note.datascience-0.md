### **Step 1: Understanding the Role of a Data Engineer**
A data engineer is responsible for preparing raw data so that it can be analyzed effectively by data analysts or data scientists. Their tasks include collecting, cleaning, transforming, and storing data in an organized manner.

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning Process**
This step ensures the data is free of inconsistencies, errors, or missing values. The cleaning process involves:
1. **Identifying Missing Data:** Checking for empty or incorrect values.
2. **Handling Duplicates:** Removing unnecessary duplicates to maintain data integrity.
3. **Standardizing Formats:** Ensuring consistency in dates, currencies, categories, etc.
4. **Correcting Errors:** Fixing typos and incorrect entries.
5. **Filtering Outliers:** Removing data points that could distort analysis.

### **Step 3: Data Transformation**
Once cleaned, data must be transformed into a structured format that analysts and data scientists can use. This involves:
1. **Aggregating Data:** Summarizing key statistics like total sales or average customer spending.
2. **Creating New Features:** Adding new variables to help improve analysis (e.g., customer segmentation based on spending habits).
3. **Converting Data Types:** Changing formats (e.g., converting string dates into a timestamp format).
4. **Merging Different Datasets:** Combining information from various sources for comprehensive insights.

### **Step 4: Storing Data**
After cleaning and transforming, the data should be stored properly to prevent issues later. This includes:
1. **Choosing the Right Database:** SQL databases for structured data, NoSQL databases for unstructured data.
2. **Optimizing Storage:** Compressing large datasets and indexing data for fast retrieval.
3. **Maintaining Security:** Implementing access controls and encryption to protect sensitive information.

Sure! Let's go step by step in setting up and connecting to your PostgreSQL database for **ex00**.

### **Step 1: Setting Up PostgreSQL**
You have two options:
1. **Using PostgreSQL Installed Locally** – If PostgreSQL is already installed on your machine (e.g., through your campus environment).
2. **Using Docker Compose** – If you're running PostgreSQL inside a virtual machine (VM) or don't have it installed directly.

#### **Option 1: Using PostgreSQL Locally**
If PostgreSQL is installed:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running with:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start postgresql  # Linux
   brew services start postgresql  # macOS
   ```
3. Log in to PostgreSQL using the credentials provided:
   ```sh
   psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
   ```
4. Enter the password `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

#### **Option 2: Using Docker Compose**
If you're using a VM or don't have PostgreSQL installed, you must set up **Docker Compose**:
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose if they are not already installed.
2. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following contents:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.1'

   services:
     db:
       image: postgres
       restart: always
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: your_login
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
         POSTGRES_DB: piscineds
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
   ```
3. Run the following command to start PostgreSQL inside Docker:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Once the container is running, connect to the database with:
   ```sh
   psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
   ```
5. Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

### **Step 3: Verifying the Connection**
Once you connect successfully, you can check if the database is running with:
```sh
\l  # Lists available databases
\dt # Lists tables inside the current database
```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your `piscineds` database listed!

Would you like help with SQL queries or managing tables next?


*********************************
That error means that the PostgreSQL service is not installed or not recognized by **systemd**, which is the service manager on your system. Here are a few things you can check:

### **1. Verify PostgreSQL Installation**
Run the following command to check if PostgreSQL is installed:
```sh
psql --version
```
If PostgreSQL is not installed, you may need to install it first.

### **2. Install PostgreSQL (if missing)**
If you’re on **Ubuntu or Debian**, install PostgreSQL with:
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
For **CentOS or Red Hat**, use:
```sh
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
```
For **Arch Linux**, use:
```sh
sudo pacman -S postgresql
```

### **3. Check Available Services**
Run this command to see if PostgreSQL is recognized by `systemctl`:
```sh
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep postgresql
```
If the PostgreSQL service is not listed, it may be named differently. Try:
```sh
systemctl list-units --type=service | grep postgres
```
You may need to use an alternative service name like `postgresql-14.service` depending on your installed version.

### **4. Enable and Start PostgreSQL**
If PostgreSQL is installed but not running, enable and start it:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

### **5. Use an Alternative Command**
If `systemctl` is not managing PostgreSQL, try starting it directly with:
```sh
sudo service postgresql start
```
or for manual startup:
```sh
sudo -u postgres pg_ctl start -D /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

Let me know what output you get, and I’ll guide you further!
*******************************

Great! You have PostgreSQL installed. Now, let's go step by step to set up your database and connect to it.

### **Step 1: Start the PostgreSQL Service**
Since you've installed PostgreSQL, ensure the service is running with:
```sh
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```
If you still get an error, try:
```sh
sudo service postgresql start
```
or check the service status:
```sh
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
If PostgreSQL is running, it should display **Active (running)**.

### **Step 2: Log in to PostgreSQL**
Now, switch to the PostgreSQL user and open the PostgreSQL console:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```
If you see the PostgreSQL prompt (`postgres=#`), you're inside the database.

### **Step 3: Create a Database**
Since your database should be named `piscineds`, create it by running:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE piscineds;
```
To verify, check the list of databases:
```sql
\l
```

### **Step 4: Create a User and Grant Access**
Your username should be your student login. To create it and set the password:
```sql
CREATE USER your_login WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
```
Grant privileges so you can fully manage the `piscineds` database:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO your_login;
```

### **Step 5: Connect Using psql**
Now, exit PostgreSQL with `\q` and try connecting using your credentials:
```sh
psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

If everything works, you're successfully connected! Let me know if you run into any issues.
****************************

Got it! Let's go step by step to make sure you're properly connected to your PostgreSQL database.

### **Step 1: Ensure PostgreSQL is Running**
If PostgreSQL is installed locally, check if the service is active:
```sh
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```
If that doesn’t work, try:
```sh
sudo service postgresql start
```
Verify the status:
```sh
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```
It should say **Active (running)**.

### **Step 2: Verify Database Creation**
Switch to the PostgreSQL interactive terminal:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Then check if the database `piscineds` exists:
```sql
\l
```
If it's missing, create it:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE piscineds;
```

### **Step 3: Create Your User and Assign Privileges**
Since your login username should match your student login, create your user:
```sql
CREATE USER your_login WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO your_login;
```

### **Step 4: Connect to the Database**
Exit PostgreSQL with `\q` and now try connecting using:
```sh
psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

### **Step 5: If Using Docker**
If you're running PostgreSQL in a VM or Docker, follow these steps:
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: your_login
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
      POSTGRES_DB: piscineds
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```
2. Run:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
3. Once the container is running, connect with:
```sh
psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
And enter the password when asked.

### **Step 6: Validate Everything**
Once connected, run:
```sql
\dt
```
This ensures the database is functioning.

Let me know if anything doesn’t work!

*********************

Great! PostgreSQL is successfully running. Now, let's confirm that you can access your database.

### **Step 1: Connect to PostgreSQL**
Run the following command to log in:
```sh
psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

### **Step 2: Verify Your Database**
Once inside PostgreSQL, check if your database `piscineds` exists:
```sql
\l
```
If it appears in the list, you're good to go!

### **Step 3: Test Table Creation (Optional)**
To ensure everything works properly, you can try creating a test table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE test_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);
```
Then verify it:
```sql
\dt
```

### **Step 4: Exit PostgreSQL**
If everything works fine, exit the session with:
```sql
\q
```

Let me know how it goes! If you encounter any issues, I’ll help you troubleshoot. 🚀

********************************

Yes, you must complete those steps before connecting to the database **if** the database `piscineds` and the user `your_login` do not already exist.

### **When You Need These Steps**:
- If you are setting up PostgreSQL for the first time.
- If the database `piscineds` has not been created yet.
- If the user `your_login` does not exist or has not been granted access.

### **When You Can Skip These Steps**:
- If `piscineds` already exists (`\l` confirms it).
- If the user `your_login` already exists and has the correct permissions.
- If you can already connect with:
  ```sh
  psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
  ```
  and successfully enter `"mysecretpassword"`.

To quickly check, you can run:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql -c "\l"
```
If `piscineds` is listed, and your user exists, then you can proceed directly to connecting.

Let me know if you need any troubleshooting help! 🚀
*********************

The password you need to enter when prompted is **"mysecretpassword"** (without quotes). 

So when you run:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
You'll see:
```
Password:
```
At this point, type:
```
mysecretpassword
```
and hit **Enter**.

If the connection fails, double-check:
1. The username (`arajapak`) exists in PostgreSQL.
2. The database `piscineds` was created.
3. The user `arajapak` was granted access to `piscineds`:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
```

Let me know if you need help troubleshooting! 🚀

********************
This error indicates that the password authentication for the user **"arajapak"** is failing. Here’s how you can fix it step by step:

### **Step 1: Confirm the User Exists in PostgreSQL**
Log in as the **postgres** superuser to check if `arajapak` is correctly set up:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Once inside PostgreSQL, verify if the user exists:
```sql
SELECT usename FROM pg_user;
```
If `arajapak` is not listed, you need to create it:
```sql
CREATE USER arajapak WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
```

### **Step 2: Reset the Password**
If the user **does** exist but the password seems incorrect, reset it:
```sql
ALTER USER arajapak WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
```

### **Step 3: Grant Privileges**
Ensure that `arajapak` has the right access to `piscineds`:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
```

### **Step 4: Check Authentication Method**
Open the PostgreSQL configuration file (`pg_hba.conf`) to check authentication settings:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf
```
Look for the line that handles connections like this:
```
local   all             all                                     md5
```
If it's not **md5** (password-based authentication), change it, then save and exit.

### **Step 5: Restart PostgreSQL**
Apply the changes by restarting PostgreSQL:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

### **Step 6: Attempt Login Again**
Now try connecting again with:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter **"mysecretpassword"** when prompted.

Let me know if you're still getting errors! 🚀

***********************
You're in PostgreSQL, so that's progress! The "Permission denied" message is likely due to restrictions on your home directory, but it's not preventing you from accessing the database.

Now that you're inside PostgreSQL (`postgres=#`), let's confirm your database and user setup:

### **Step 1: Verify Database Creation**
Run:
```sql
\l
```
Check if `piscineds` is listed. If not, create it:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE piscineds;
```

### **Step 2: Confirm Your User Exists**
Run:
```sql
SELECT usename FROM pg_user;
```
If `arajapak` is not listed, create the user:
```sql
CREATE USER arajapak WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
```

### **Step 3: Grant User Access to Database**
Make sure `arajapak` has full access:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
```

### **Step 4: Exit PostgreSQL**
Once all steps are completed, exit PostgreSQL:
```sql
\q
```

### **Step 5: Attempt Connection**
Now, retry:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter **"mysecretpassword"** when prompted.

Let me know if you run into any issues! 🚀
************************

It looks like you ran those commands in **Bash** instead of inside PostgreSQL.

### **How to Run PostgreSQL Commands Correctly**
You need to first **enter the PostgreSQL interactive terminal** before running SQL commands. Follow these steps:

1️⃣ **Log in to PostgreSQL as the superuser**:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```
This will bring up the PostgreSQL prompt (`postgres=#`).

2️⃣ **Now, run your commands inside PostgreSQL**:
```sql
\l  -- Lists all databases
CREATE DATABASE piscineds;  -- Creates the database
CREATE USER arajapak WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';  -- Creates the user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;  -- Grants permissions
```

3️⃣ **Exit PostgreSQL after running these commands**:
```sql
\q
```

4️⃣ **Now, try connecting to your database**:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter **"mysecretpassword"** when prompted.

Let me know if this works for you! 🚀

   ```
   You should now see **piscineds** listed.

Try these steps and let me know how it goes! 🚀
*********************

Nice! Your `piscineds` database has been created successfully. Now, the next step is to set up your user `arajapak` and grant access.

### **Step 1: Create Your User**
Since the database is owned by `postgres`, you'll need to create your user:
```sql
CREATE USER arajapak WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
```

### **Step 2: Grant Access to Your Database**
Now, allow `arajapak` to access and manage `piscineds`:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
```

### **Step 3: Exit PostgreSQL**
Once privileges are granted, exit PostgreSQL:
```sql
\q
```

### **Step 4: Try Connecting as `arajapak`**
Now, attempt to connect using:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

Let me know how it goes! 🚀
*****************
Awesome! You've successfully created the database `piscineds`, set up the user `arajapak`, and granted privileges. Now, let's test the connection as your new user.

### **Step 1: Exit PostgreSQL**
Since you're still logged in as the `postgres` superuser, exit the session:
```sql
\q
```

### **Step 2: Try Connecting as `arajapak`**
Run this command in your terminal:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
When prompted, enter **"mysecretpassword"**.

### **Step 3: Verify the Connection**
Once inside, you should see the PostgreSQL prompt (`piscineds=>`). Try running:
```sql
\dt
```
This will check if there are any tables (if none exist yet, that's expected).

Let me know if you run into any issues, or if you need help creating tables! 🚀
*******************

Fantastic! You've successfully connected to your `piscineds` database as `arajapak`. Everything is working as expected! 🚀

Now, you're ready to start working with your database. Here are a few useful commands to get started:

### **Basic PostgreSQL Commands**
- **Check existing tables**:
  ```sql
  \dt
  ```
  If there are no tables, it will return **"No relations found"**, which is expected.

- **Create a test table**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE test_table (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(50),
      age INT
  );
  ```

- **Insert data into the table**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO test_table (name, age) VALUES ('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30);
  ```

- **View the data**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM test_table;
  ```

- **Exit PostgreSQL**:
  ```sql
  \q
  ```

You’re fully set up! Let me know if you need help with anything else. 🎯
*************************

That means your database is empty—there are no tables yet! But don't worry, you can create tables and start inserting data.

### **Step 1: Create a Table**
Try running this command inside PostgreSQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    quantity_sold INT,
    price_per_unit DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE
);
```
This creates a basic `sales_data` table with an ID, product name, quantity sold, price, and sale date.

### **Step 2: Verify Table Creation**
Check if the table was created by running:
```sql
\dt
```
You should now see **sales_data** listed.

### **Step 3: Insert Sample Data**
Try adding some test data:
```sql
INSERT INTO sales_data (product_name, quantity_sold, price_per_unit, sale_date) 
VALUES ('Laptop', 5, 1200.00, '2025-04-20'), ('Smartphone', 10, 800.00, '2025-04-19');
```

### **Step 4: Retrieve Data**
View the inserted data with:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sales_data;
```

Now, you're ready to start working with your database! Let me know if you need help with queries or anything else. 🚀
****************************

For **ex00**, the key requirement is that you can connect to your PostgreSQL database using the given command:

```sh
psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```

Here’s a quick checklist to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. **PostgreSQL Installed** → Confirm it's installed with:
   ```sh
   psql --version
   ```

2. **Database Exists** → Verify inside PostgreSQL:
   ```sh
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "\l"
   ```
   Ensure `piscineds` is listed.

3. **User Setup** → Check if your user exists:
   ```sh
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT usename FROM pg_user;"
   ```
   If missing, create it:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER your_login WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO your_login;
   ```

4. **Test Connection** → Exit PostgreSQL (`\q`) and run:
   ```sh
   psql -U your_login -d piscineds -h localhost -W
   ```
   Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If authentication fails, reset the password:
     ```sql
     ALTER USER your_login WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';
     ```
   - If using a VM, ensure `pg_hba.conf` allows MD5 authentication.

*****************
### **Explanation of Ex02: First Table**  
In **Ex02**, your task is to create **PostgreSQL tables** using data from CSV files inside the `customer/` folder.  

### **Steps to Complete Ex02**  

#### **1️⃣ Identify the CSV Files & Their Columns**  
Inside the `customer/` folder, you have these files:  
- `data_2022_oct.csv`
- `data_2022_nov.csv`
- `data_2022_dec.csv`
- `data_2022_jan.csv`

Each file represents a **table** you need to create in PostgreSQL, named after the filename **without the `.csv` extension**.

Before proceeding, **inspect the CSV structure**:
```sh
head customer/data_2022_oct.csv
```
This will show the first few lines, including **column names**.

---

#### **2️⃣ Create PostgreSQL Tables**  
Each table must:
✅ **Match the column names in the CSV**  
✅ **Contain at least 6 different data types**  
✅ **Include a DATETIME column as the first column**  

Example table creation:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP,
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    email TEXT,
    purchase_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    is_member BOOLEAN
);
```
Adjust column types according to the actual CSV data.

---

#### **3️⃣ Import CSV Data into PostgreSQL**  
Use **COPY** or **\copy** to load data:  
```sql
COPY data_2022_oct FROM '/path/to/customer/data_2022_oct.csv'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
```
Alternatively, if using **psql**:
```sh
\copy data_2022_oct FROM 'customer/data_2022_oct.csv' CSV HEADER;
```
Ensure PostgreSQL has permission to read the file.

---

#### **4️⃣ Verify the Data & Submission**  
Check the imported data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_oct LIMIT 10;
```
Once all tables are created and data is imported, submit them in the **`ex02/` directory**.

---

Let me know if you need help with specific CSV data types or troubleshooting the import! 🚀🔥
*****
No problem! Let's break it down step by step.  

### **What You Need to Do**  
You have a folder called **customer/** that contains **CSV files**:
- `data_2022_oct.csv`
- `data_2022_nov.csv`
- `data_2022_dec.csv`
- `data_2022_jan.csv`

Your task is to **create PostgreSQL tables** using the data inside these CSV files. Each table should be named **after the CSV file, but without the `.csv` extension**.  

For example:  
- The table for `data_2022_oct.csv` should be named **`data_2022_oct`**  
- The table for `data_2022_nov.csv` should be named **`data_2022_nov`**  
- And so on...

---

### **Steps to Create the PostgreSQL Table**  
#### **1️⃣ Open the CSV and Identify the Columns**  
Before creating the table, inspect the CSV file to see what columns it has:
```sh
head customer/data_2022_oct.csv
```
This will show you the first few lines of the file, including column names.

---

#### **2️⃣ Create the Table in PostgreSQL**  
Use the column names from the CSV to define the table in SQL. The table **must have a DATETIME column** as the **first column**, and at least **six different data types**.

Example SQL command:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP,  -- First column (DATETIME)
    customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- Integer (Auto-incrementing ID)
    name VARCHAR(100),  -- String
    age INT,  -- Integer
    email TEXT,  -- Text
    purchase_amount DECIMAL(10,2),  -- Decimal
    is_member BOOLEAN  -- Boolean
);
```
Adjust column names and data types **based on the actual CSV file**.

---

#### **3️⃣ Import Data from CSV into PostgreSQL**  
Once the table is created, you need to load the CSV data into it.

Using the **COPY** command:
```sql
COPY data_2022_oct FROM '/path/to/customer/data_2022_oct.csv'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
```
Or, if using **psql**:
```sh
\copy data_2022_oct FROM 'customer/data_2022_oct.csv' CSV HEADER;
```
This will insert data from the CSV into the PostgreSQL table.

---

#### **4️⃣ Verify the Data**  
After importing, check if data is properly loaded:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_oct LIMIT 10;
```
This will display the first 10 rows of your newly created table.

---

Now, repeat the process for all the CSV files (`data_2022_nov.csv`, `data_2022_dec.csv`, etc.), creating tables with corresponding names and importing their data.  

Let me know if you need help with any step! 🚀🔥  
*****************
Good move! Running `head customer/data_2022_oct.csv` helps you see the first few lines of the file, including **column names** and sample data.

### **Next Steps for Ex02**
✅ **1. Identify the Column Names** → Look at the output from `head` to see what columns exist in the CSV.  
✅ **2. Create a Table Based on the CSV Structure** → Define column names and use different data types.  
✅ **3. Import Data** → Use `COPY` or `\copy` to load the CSV into PostgreSQL.  

Did you get a good look at the column names? If you’re unsure about data types, I can help you define them! 🚀  
******
Great! Now that you've inspected the CSV structure using `head customer/data_2022_oct.csv`, you can **create a corresponding PostgreSQL table** based on these column names.

### **Step 1: Define the Table in PostgreSQL**
Since the CSV includes these columns:
- `event_time` (Timestamp)
- `event_type` (Text)
- `product_id` (Integer)
- `price` (Decimal)
- `user_id` (Integer)
- `user_session` (UUID or Text)

We can create the table like this:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  -- First column (DATETIME, mandatory)
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```
If `user_session` isn't strictly a UUID, you can define it as `TEXT` instead.

### **Step 2: Import CSV Data into PostgreSQL**
Use `COPY` or `\copy` to load data from your CSV:
```sql
COPY data_2022_oct FROM '/absolute/path/to/customer/data_2022_oct.csv'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true);
```
Or, if using **psql**:
```sh
\copy data_2022_oct FROM 'customer/data_2022_oct.csv' CSV HEADER;
```
Make sure PostgreSQL has permission to read the file.

### **Step 3: Verify the Data**
Run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_oct LIMIT 10;
```
This will display the first 10 rows of your newly created table.

Repeat the same process for **data_2022_nov.csv, data_2022_dec.csv, and data_2022_jan.csv**, naming each table accordingly.

Let me know if you need help with any errors or table adjustments! 🚀
*******
Yes! Before you run the `CREATE TABLE` command, **you must connect to your PostgreSQL database (`piscineds`)**. Follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Connect to Your Database**
Run this command in your terminal:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.  

Once connected, you should see the **PostgreSQL prompt** like this:
```
piscineds=>
```

### **2️⃣ Create the Table**
Now you can run:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  -- First column (DATETIME, mandatory)
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

### **3️⃣ Verify Table Creation**
After creating the table, check that it exists:
```sql
\dt
```
This will show a list of tables inside your database.

Let me know if you need further clarification! 🚀🔥
******
It looks like you tried to run the `CREATE TABLE` command **directly in Bash**, but **SQL commands must be executed inside PostgreSQL**.

### **How to Run the Command Correctly**
1️⃣ **First, connect to your PostgreSQL database**:  
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

2️⃣ **Once inside PostgreSQL (`piscineds=>` prompt), run**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  -- First column (DATETIME, mandatory)
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

3️⃣ **Verify that the table was created**:
```sql
\dt
```
You should see `data_2022_oct` listed.

You're almost there! Try these steps and let me know if you run into any issues. 🚀
***
It looks like you don’t have the necessary permissions to create a table in the `public` schema. This happens when your user account (`arajapak`) isn’t granted the correct privileges.

### **Fix: Grant the Necessary Permissions**
Try running this command as the **PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`)**:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO arajapak;
```
If you aren’t connected as `postgres`, switch to the superuser first:
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```
Then run:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO arajapak;
```
Now, exit (`\q`) and reconnect as `arajapak`, then try creating the table again.

Let me know if you need help troubleshooting! 🚀
*****
Great! You’ve successfully **granted privileges** to `arajapak` on the `public` schema. 🚀  

Now, let's verify that **your user can create tables**:  
1️⃣ Exit PostgreSQL:
```sql
\q
```
2️⃣ Reconnect as `arajapak`:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

3️⃣ Try **creating the table again**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  -- First column (DATETIME, mandatory)
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

4️⃣ **Check if the table exists**:
```sql
\dt
```

Let me know if you run into any issues! 🚀🔥
*****
The **"permission denied for schema public"** error means your user (`arajapak`) still doesn't have the right privileges to create tables in the **public schema**.

### **Fix the Permissions Again**
1️⃣ **Switch to the PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`)**
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

2️⃣ **Grant permissions on the database AND schema**
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO arajapak;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO arajapak;
```

3️⃣ **Exit PostgreSQL**
```sql
\q
```

4️⃣ **Reconnect as `arajapak`**
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```

5️⃣ **Try creating the table again**
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,                                       
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

6️⃣ **Check if the table is created**
```sql
\dt
```

This should fix the issue! Let me know if you run into any errors. 🚀🔥
****
Excellent! You've successfully granted all necessary privileges to your user (`arajapak`). 🚀  

### **Next Steps: Create the Table**
Now that permissions are set, reconnect to your database:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

Then, run the **table creation command again**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  -- First column (DATETIME, mandatory)
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

### **Verify Table Creation**
After running the command, check if the table exists:
```sql
\dt
```
You should now see **`data_2022_oct`** listed!

Let me know if everything works smoothly or if you run into any errors! 🔥
******
You're still facing the **"permission denied for schema public"** error, which means your user (`arajapak`) doesn't have the right permissions despite granting privileges earlier.

### **Try This Final Fix**
1️⃣ **Reconnect as the PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`)**
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

2️⃣ **Explicitly grant schema ownership to `arajapak`**
```sql
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO arajapak;
```

3️⃣ **Grant full permissions again**
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO arajapak;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO arajapak;
```

4️⃣ **Exit PostgreSQL**
```sql
\q
```

5️⃣ **Reconnect as `arajapak` and try creating the table again**
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

6️⃣ **Verify table creation**
```sql
\dt
```

This should resolve the issue! Let me know if you hit any errors. 🚀🔥
******
You're still getting the **permission denied for schema public** error, which means PostgreSQL isn't recognizing your user (`arajapak`) as having full control. Let's try one more approach to fully reset the permissions.

### **Step 1: Ensure You're the Superuser**
First, switch to the **PostgreSQL superuser (`postgres`)**:  
```sh
sudo -u postgres psql
```

### **Step 2: Explicitly Grant Ownership Again**
Run the following commands:
```sql
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO arajapak;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE piscineds TO arajapak;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO arajapak;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO arajapak;
ALTER ROLE arajapak SUPERUSER;
```

This **last command** (`ALTER ROLE arajapak SUPERUSER;`) makes your user a **superuser**, meaning it won’t run into permission errors again.

### **Step 3: Exit and Reconnect**
Exit PostgreSQL:
```sql
\q
```
Then reconnect as `arajapak`:
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

### **Step 4: Try Creating the Table Again**
Now, run:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_oct (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

### **Final Check**
Verify that the table was successfully created:
```sql
\dt
```

After running these steps, PostgreSQL should allow `arajapak` to create tables without any more permission errors. Try this and let me know if anything still doesn't work! 🚀🔥
******

*****
If you've **quit PostgreSQL (`\q`)**, you'll need to **reconnect** before running the query. Follow these steps:

### **1️⃣ Reconnect to Your Database**
```sh
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Enter `"mysecretpassword"` when prompted.

### **2️⃣ Run the Query**
Once inside PostgreSQL (`piscineds=>` prompt), execute:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_oct LIMIT 5;
```

If everything is set up correctly, this will show the **first 5 rows** from your table.

Let me know if you need help troubleshooting! 🚀🔥
******
You're doing great! 🚀 If the `\copy` command runs successfully, PostgreSQL will **import the CSV data** into your table. You might not see an explicit confirmation message, so let's verify the import:

### **Check if data is inserted**
After running the `\copy` command, execute:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_oct LIMIT 5;
```
This will show the **first 5 rows** of your table. If data appears, the import was successful! 🎉

### **Troubleshooting (If Still Empty)**
If the table still shows **(0 rows)**:
1️⃣ Check the **file path**:
```sql
\copy data_2022_oct FROM '/absolute/path/to/customer/data_2022_oct.csv' CSV HEADER;
```
Ensure you use the **correct file location**.

2️⃣ **Check PostgreSQL permissions** on the CSV file:
```sh
ls -l customer/data_2022_oct.csv
```
If necessary, update permissions:
```sh
chmod 644 customer/data_2022_oct.csv
```

3️⃣ **Try loading data again**:
```sql
\copy data_2022_oct FROM 'customer/data_2022_oct.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

After retrying, check your table with:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_oct LIMIT 10;
```

********
Looks like the **structure** of `data_2022_nov.csv` is **identical** to `data_2022_oct.csv`, meaning you can **reuse** the same table definition!

### **Steps to Create & Import `data_2022_nov`**
✅ **1️⃣ Create the Table**  
Run the following in PostgreSQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE data_2022_nov (
    event_time TIMESTAMP,  
    event_type TEXT,
    product_id INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    user_id BIGINT,
    user_session UUID
);
```

✅ **2️⃣ Import the CSV Data**  
Use:
```sql
\copy data_2022_nov FROM 'customer/data_2022_nov.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

✅ **3️⃣ Verify Data Import**  
Check the first few rows:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_nov LIMIT 5;
```
Check total row count:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data_2022_nov;
```

Once `data_2022_nov` is set up, **repeat the same process** for `data_2022_dec.csv` and `data_2022_jan.csv`.

Let me know if anything needs troubleshooting! 🚀🔥
*****
Yes, there **is an error** in your `\copy` command. You tried to **import `data_2022_dec.csv` into `data_2022_nov`**, which means the wrong file was inserted into the table.  

### **Fix: Use the Correct Command**
To correctly load the **December data** into the **`data_2022_dec`** table, use:  
```sql
\copy data_2022_dec FROM 'customer/data_2022_dec.csv' CSV HEADER;
```

### **Next Steps**
✅ **Run the correct `\copy` command** above.  
✅ **Check the imported data**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_2022_dec LIMIT 5;
```
✅ **Verify total rows in `data_2022_dec`**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM data_2022_dec;
```

If the `data_2022_nov` table already has incorrect data, we may need to **truncate** it and re-import `data_2022_nov.csv`. Let me know if you need help fixing it! 🚀🔥

CREATE TABLE item (
    product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_id BIGINT,
    category_code TEXT,
    brand TEXT
);

psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhos -W

Of course! Let’s break down the **psql** command you’re using:

```bash
psql -U yourlogin -d piscineds -h localhost -W
```
Each part of this command has a specific role:

### **🔍 Explanation of Each Option**
- **`psql`** → The PostgreSQL command-line client used to connect and interact with your database.
- **`-U yourlogin`** → The `-U` flag specifies the **username** for the database connection.  
  - Here, `"yourlogin"` should be replaced with your actual PostgreSQL user (e.g., `arajapak`).
- **`-d piscineds`** → The `-d` flag specifies the **database name** you want to connect to.  
  - In this case, `"piscineds"` is the name of your database.
- **`-h localhost`** → The `-h` flag specifies the **host** where PostgreSQL is running.  
  - `"localhost"` means the database is hosted on your own machine.  
  - If PostgreSQL were running on another server, you’d replace `"localhost"` with the server’s IP or domain.
- **`-W`** → This flag **forces psql to ask for a password**.  
  - If your PostgreSQL user **requires password authentication**, this ensures you're prompted to enter it.

---

### **🛠 Example Usage**
If your PostgreSQL user is **arajapak** and your database is **piscineds**, and you're running it on **port 5433**, you'd use:
```bash
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -p 5433 -W
```
You’ll be prompted to enter your password (`mysecretpassword`).

---

### 🚀 **Key Takeaways**
- **`-U` = Username**
- **`-d` = Database name**
- **`-h` = Host (local or remote)**
- **`-W` = Prompt for password**

Would you like more details on any specific part? 😊🔍  
Let me know how I can assist further! 🚀🔥
Yes, exactly! 🔍  

The **`-p` flag** in the **psql** command specifies the **port number** that PostgreSQL is running on.  

### **Example Usage:**  
```bash
psql -U arajapak -d piscineds -h localhost -p 5433 -W
```
In this command:
- **`-p 5433`** → You're telling psql to **connect to PostgreSQL on port 5433** instead of the default port (`5432`).

### **Why is Port Important?**
- **Default PostgreSQL Port** = `5432`
- If you've changed the port (e.g., `5433` in your case), you **must specify it** in the connection command.
- If you don’t specify a port, **psql assumes 5432** and might fail if your database runs on a different port.



Yes! Using the command:  
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'item';
```  
**You can replace `'item'` with any table name** to see its columns. 🚀  

For example, if you want to check the columns in a table named **`products`**, run:
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'products';
```

This method works for **any table** in your database, making it easy to see which columns exist before running queries! 🔍  

Would you like to list more details, like **data types or constraints** for columns? 😊💡


You're absolutely right! **Any column in the `item` table can be updated or queried**, just like how you modified the `brand` values. 🚀  

### **🔹 Example Queries for Changing Different Columns**
1️⃣ **Update `category_code` for a product**  
```sql
UPDATE item SET category_code = 'TECH001' WHERE product_id = 1;
```
Now, `product_id = 1` will have `category_code = 'TECH001'`.

2️⃣ **Update `category_id` for a product**  
```sql
UPDATE item SET category_id = 999 WHERE product_id = 2;
```
Now, `product_id = 2` will have `category_id = 999`.

3️⃣ **Change multiple values at once**  
```sql
UPDATE item SET brand = 'Samsung', category_code = 'ELEC999' WHERE product_id = 3;
```
This updates both `brand` and `category_code` for `product_id = 3`.

---

### **🔹 Querying Data with Updates**
Once you've made changes, retrieve data like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM item WHERE product_id = 3;
```
or
```sql
SELECT brand, category_id FROM item WHERE category_code = 'ELEC999';
```
This helps verify your updates!
