Great, it sounds like you've already configured the shared folder between your host machine and the Debian virtual machine. If you're still encountering issues or need further guidance, here are a few steps to verify and troubleshoot your shared folder setup:

---

### **1. Verify Shared Folder Settings in Virtual Machine**
- Make sure the shared folder path (`home/arajapak/discovery-picine`) is correctly selected in your VM settings.
- If youâ€™re using a tool like VirtualBox, ensure:
  - **Folder Path** points to the correct directory.
  - **Folder Name** is accurate, as this is how it will appear in your virtual machine.
  - The **Auto-mount** and **Make Permanent** options are selected.

---

### **2. Install Guest Additions (if using VirtualBox)**
Shared folders often require Guest Additions installed on the Debian VM:
1. Mount the Guest Additions ISO in your VM.
2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms
   sudo sh /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
   ```
3. Reboot the VM:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

---

### **3. Mount the Shared Folder in the Virtual Machine**
In Debian, you need to manually mount the shared folder:
1. Create a mount point:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/shared
   ```
2. Mount the shared folder:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t vboxsf discovery-picine /mnt/shared
   ```
   Replace `discovery-picine` with the **Folder Name** you set in the VM configuration.

---

### **4. Verify Folder Access**
Navigate to the shared folder in the VM and check if you can access its contents:
```bash
ls /mnt/shared
```
If you see the files from the host machine, the setup is working!

---

### **5. Troubleshoot Permissions**
If you encounter permission issues:
- Add your user to the `vboxsf` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG vboxsf <your-username>
  ```
- Log out and back in for the changes to take effect.
