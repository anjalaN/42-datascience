The `re` module in Python stands for **regular expressions** and provides powerful tools for pattern matching, searching, and manipulating strings. It allows you to define complex search patterns and use them to find or modify parts of strings. Here's an overview of its most common use cases:

---

### 1. **Basic Import**
To use regular expressions, you start by importing the `re` module:
```python
import re
```

### 2. **Key Functions in `re`**

| Function        | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `re.match()`    | Checks for a match only at the beginning of a string.                     |
| `re.search()`   | Searches the whole string for the first occurrence of a match.            |
| `re.findall()`  | Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in a string as a list. |
| `re.finditer()` | Returns an iterator yielding match objects for all matches in a string.   |
| `re.sub()`      | Substitutes matches with another string.                                  |
| `re.split()`    | Splits a string by occurrences of the pattern.                            |
| `re.compile()`  | Compiles a regular expression pattern into a reusable object.             |

### 3. **Example Usage**

#### **Matching Strings**
```python
import re

# Match a string that starts with "Hello"
pattern = r"Hello"
result = re.match(pattern, "Hello, World!")
print(result)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'>
```

#### **Searching in Strings**
```python
# Search for "World" anywhere in the string
result = re.search(r"World", "Hello, World!")
print(result)  # Output: <re.Match object; span=(7, 12), match='World'>
```

#### **Find All Matches**
```python
# Find all occurrences of digits
result = re.findall(r"\d+", "My number is 12345 and PIN is 678.")
print(result)  # Output: ['12345', '678']
```

#### **Substitution**
```python
# Replace digits with an asterisk
result = re.sub(r"\d", "*", "Phone: 123-456-7890")
print(result)  # Output: Phone: ***-***-****
```

#### **Splitting Strings**
```python
# Split the string by commas
result = re.split(r",", "apple,orange,banana")
print(result)  # Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']
```

### 4. **Pattern Syntax**
Regular expressions use special characters to define patterns:
- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
- `^`: Matches the start of a string.
- `$`: Matches the end of a string.
- `*`: Matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding character.
- `+`: Matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding character.
- `{n}`: Matches exactly `n` repetitions.
- `[abc]`: Matches any character inside the brackets.
- `\d`: Matches any digit (0–9).
- `\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (a–z, A–Z, 0–9, _).
