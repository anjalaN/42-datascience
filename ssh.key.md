Let me walk you through your steps and confirm if they are correct for generating an SSH key on VirtualBox with Debian and adding it to settings:

---

### **Step 1: Generate SSH Key**
Your first step with `ssh-keygen` is spot-on:
1. Open the terminal in your Debian VirtualBox.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Press **Enter** to save the key in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
   - Optionally, add a passphrase for extra security or leave it blank for convenience.
4. This generates two files in `~/.ssh/`:
   - **id_rsa**: Your private key (keep this secret).
   - **id_rsa.pub**: Your public key (to be shared).

---

### **Step 2: Display the Public Key**
Your second step with `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` is correct:
1. Run:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
2. Copy the entire output of the command. This is your public key, and it typically starts with `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`.

---

### **Step 3: Add the Public Key**
You are correct about adding the key to settings. Depending on the application or service you're connecting to, hereâ€™s what to do:
1. Go to the settings of the service you want to connect to (e.g., Git, GitHub, Vogsphere, etc.).
2. Find the **SSH Keys** or **Access Keys** section.
3. Paste the copied key from Step 2 into the field provided.
4. Save the changes.

---

### **Step 4 (Optional): Test the SSH Connection**
Once the key is added, ensure it's working:
1. Test the connection to the host by running:
   ```bash
   ssh -T <user>@<hostname>
   ```
   For example:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@vogsphere.42paris.fr
   ```
2. If the connection is successful, it confirms that the key is correctly configured.

---

### **Summary**
Your steps are correct:
- Generate the SSH key with `ssh-keygen`.
- Display the public key with `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
- Copy the key to the relevant settings of the service you're using.

If youâ€™d like assistance testing the connection or troubleshooting, let me know. Excellent work getting this far! ðŸš€

To test your SSH connection to `vogsphere.42paris.fr`, the command you provided is correct:

```bash
ssh -T git@vogsphere.42paris.fr
```

### Possible Outcomes:
1. **Successful Authentication**:  
   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see a message confirming the SSH connection. For example:
   ```
   Welcome to Vogsphere!
   ```

2. **Permission Denied or Authentication Failed**:  
   If the connection fails, you might see something like this:
   ```
   Permission denied (publickey).
   ```
   In this case, check the following:
   - Ensure that your public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) has been correctly added to the Vogsphere settings.
   - Verify that the private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`) exists and is properly configured.

3. **Host Verification Prompt**:  
   If youâ€™re connecting for the first time, you may see:
   ```
   The authenticity of host 'vogsphere.42paris.fr' can't be established.
   ```
   Type `yes` to continue, and the server's fingerprint will be saved to `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

---

### Debugging Tips:
- If it still doesn't work, add the `-v` (verbose) flag for more details:
  ```bash
  ssh -vT git@vogsphere.42paris.fr
  ```
  This will provide more information about where the problem lies.
