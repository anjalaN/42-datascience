*************
To share a folder between your PC and Debian, you can use **Samba**, a popular tool for file sharing across different operating systems. Here's a quick overview of the process:

1. **Install Samba on Debian**:
   Run the following commands in your terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install samba smbclient cifs-utils
   ```

2. **Configure Samba**:
   Edit the Samba configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```
   Add the following lines at the end of the file to create a shared folder:
   ```bash
   [shared]
   path = /path/to/your/shared/folder
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/shared/folder` with the actual path of the folder you want to share.

3. **Restart Samba**:
   After saving the configuration file, restart the Samba service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart smbd
   ```

4. **Access the Shared Folder**:
   On your PC, you can access the shared folder by entering the IP address of your Debian machine in the file explorer (e.g., `\\192.168.x.x\shared`).

Let me know if you need help with any specific step!

******************
It sounds like you've already created a shared folder named `/home/discavery-Pisine` on your PC and have set it up with Debian for sharing and automounting. If you're looking to ensure everything is working properly, here are a few things to check and verify:

1. **Mounting on Debian**:
   If you've configured the shared folder on Debian, ensure it's properly mounted. You can manually mount it using the `mount` command:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t cifs -o username=your_pc_username,password=your_pc_password //your_pc_ip/discavery-Pisine /mnt/shared_folder
   ```
   Replace `your_pc_username`, `your_pc_password`, and `your_pc_ip` with the appropriate details. Also, replace `/mnt/shared_folder` with the directory where you'd like to mount it on Debian.

2. **Verify Automount**:
   If you've set it to automount, ensure the configuration is correct in `/etc/fstab`. Here’s an example entry for your shared folder:
   ```bash
   //your_pc_ip/discavery-Pisine /mnt/shared_folder cifs username=your_pc_username,password=your_pc_password,iocharset=utf8,vers=3.0 0 0
   ```
   After editing `/etc/fstab`, try remounting all entries:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -a
   ```

3. **Access the Shared Folder**:
   Once mounted, navigate to the mount point (e.g., `/mnt/shared_folder`) to access the contents.

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Check permissions on `/home/discavery-Pisine` to ensure the Debian user has the required access rights.
   - Test network connectivity between your PC and Debian machine using `ping`.
   - Verify that the Samba service (on PC) and CIFS (on Debian) are properly configured and running.

Does this align with what you're looking to achieve? If you're encountering specific issues, feel free to share, and I'll help troubleshoot!

********
It seems like your attempt to list the contents of `/home/arajapak/discovery-Pisine` returned an error stating the directory does not exist. If the folder isn't created yet, applying `chmod` to it won't work either since the path isn't valid. Here are some steps to address this issue:

1. **Verify the Folder Exists**:
   First, check if the path is correct. If you're not sure, you can list the parent directory to see if the folder is there:
   ```bash
   ls /home/arajapak
   ```
   If the folder `discovery-Pisine` is missing, you'll need to create it.

2. **Create the Folder**:
   If the folder doesn't exist, you can create it with the following command:
   ```bash
   mkdir /home/arajapak/discovery-Pisine
   ```
   After that, you can confirm its existence:
   ```bash
   ls /home/arajapak/discovery-Pisine
   ```

3. **Apply Permissions**:
   Once the folder is created, then you can apply the permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 777 /home/arajapak/discovery-Pisine
   ```
   This will give read, write, and execute permissions to all users. Be cautious with `777` permissions, as it's not recommended for sensitive directories.

4. **Check Mount Point**:
   If this folder is supposed to be a mount point for a shared folder from your PC, make sure the mount process is correctly configured (e.g., using `mount` or `/etc/fstab`).

Give these steps a try and let me know how it goes or if there’s something else I can assist you with!
*******************
If the shared folder on your PC, `/home/arajapak/discovery-piscine`, is set up and functioning correctly, but it's not showing on Debian, the issue could be related to the mounting process. Let's troubleshoot:

1. **Confirm Samba Configuration (On PC)**:
   Ensure the folder is correctly shared and accessible from the Debian system. You can test this by trying to access it from another device or using a tool like `smbclient` on Debian:
   ```bash
   smbclient -L //your_pc_ip -U your_pc_username
   ```
   Replace `your_pc_ip` and `your_pc_username` with your PC details. If the shared folder appears in the list, the sharing configuration is fine.

2. **Verify Mounting on Debian**:
   Check if the shared folder is correctly mounted on Debian. You can verify this by listing the mount points:
   ```bash
   mount | grep discovery-piscine
   ```
   If nothing is displayed, the folder is not mounted. Try mounting it manually using:
   ```bash
   sudo mount -t cifs -o username=your_pc_username,password=your_pc_password //your_pc_ip/discovery-piscine /home/arajapak/discovery-piscine
   ```

3. **Permissions and Ownership**:
   Ensure the mount point `/home/arajapak/discovery-piscine` exists on Debian. If not, create it:
   ```bash
   mkdir /home/arajapak/discovery-piscine
   ```
   After mounting, check the folder's permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -ld /home/arajapak/discovery-piscine
   ```

4. **Network Connectivity**:
   Verify the network connection between the PC and Debian. Use `ping` from Debian to your PC's IP to ensure they can communicate:
   ```bash
   ping your_pc_ip
   
   
   ********************
   Installing Python on Debian is straightforward! Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Update the Package List**:
   Start by updating your package list to ensure you have access to the latest versions:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Python**:
   Debian typically includes Python in its repositories. To install Python, run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3
   ```
   This will install Python 3, the latest major version.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   After installation, you can check the Python version by running:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

4. **Install Pip** *(Optional)*:
   Pip is Python's package manager, useful for installing Python libraries. Install it with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   ```

5. **Set Up Virtual Environment** *(Optional)*:
   If you plan to work on specific projects, you might want to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies separate:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   ```
   Then, create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

********************
To connect as the root user on Debian, follow these steps carefully. Keep in mind that using the root account should be done with caution, as it has unrestricted access to your system.

### 1. **Log in as Root**:
   If you know the root password, you can switch to the root user by typing:
   ```bash
   su
   ```
   You’ll be prompted to enter the root password. Once entered, your prompt will change to indicate that you’re logged in as root.

### 2. **Execute Commands as Root Using `sudo`** (Preferred Method):
   Debian typically disables direct root login for security reasons. Instead, you can use the `sudo` command to execute tasks requiring root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo command
   ```
   Replace `command` with what you want to execute. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

### 3. **Enable the Root Account (Optional)**:
   If you want to enable the root account and set a password for it:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd root
   ```
   You’ll be prompted to enter and confirm a new password for the root account. After this, you can log in as root using `su`.

### 4. **Exit Root Mode**:
   If you're logged in as root and want to return to your normal user:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

Would you like help performing a specific task as root? Let me know!

*****************
The difference between `su` and `su -` lies in how they switch users and set up the new user's environment:

### **`su` (Switch User)**
- It switches to another user, but it does not load the user's full environment.
- For example, if you switch to the `root` user with just `su`, you will inherit the current user's environment (like their PATH variable).
- The prompt might look like this: `root@machine:/home/currentuser$`.

### **`su -` (Switch User with Login Shell)**
- It performs a *login shell*, meaning it completely switches to the target user's environment, as if you were logging in as that user.
- This includes loading environment variables, such as `PATH`, and changing the working directory to the target user's home directory.
- It's a cleaner and more isolated switch.
- The prompt might look like this: `root@machine:~#`.

### When to Use Them:
- Use `su` if you just need quick root access while retaining some of the current user's environment.
- Use `su -` if you need a full root login environment (or any target user), especially for administrative tasks that rely on the root environment.

Would you like me to elaborate or help with an example?


*********************
To connect and access an external disk on Debian, follow these steps:

### 1. **Connect the Disk**
   Plug in your external disk via USB or another interface. Ensure it's powered on if required.

### 2. **Identify the Disk**
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   This will list all connected storage devices. Look for your external disk (e.g., `/dev/sdb` or `/dev/sdc`).

### 3. **Create a Mount Point**
   Create a directory where you want to access the disk's contents:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/external_disk
   ```

### 4. **Mount the Disk**
   Mount the disk to the directory you created:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/external_disk
   ```
   Replace `/dev/sdX1` with the correct partition name of your external disk (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`).

### 5. **Access the Disk**
   Navigate to the mount point to access the disk's contents:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/external_disk
   ```

### 6. **Unmount the Disk (When Done)**
   Before disconnecting the disk, unmount it to avoid data loss:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/external_disk
   ```

### Notes:
- If the disk uses a filesystem not supported by default (e.g., NTFS), you may need to install additional tools like `ntfs-3g`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ntfs-3g
   ```
- For automatic mounting, you can configure `/etc/fstab`.

Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!

*******************

From the output of `lsblk`, it looks like your system currently recognizes:

1. **Disk `sda`**:
   - A 20GB disk with three partitions:
     - `sda1`: 19GB, mounted as root (`/`). This is your main system partition.
     - `sda2`: A very small partition, likely unused (1KB).
     - `sda5`: 975MB, used for swap space, helping with system performance when RAM is full.

2. **Device `sr0`**:
   - A ROM device (likely your CD/DVD drive) with 1024MB capacity.

It seems no external disk is currently detected. If you've connected an external disk and it's not appearing here, you can try the following steps:

### Troubleshooting:
1. **Check Physical Connection**:
   Ensure the external disk is properly connected and powered on. Try reconnecting it to a different USB port.

2. **List Devices Again**:
   Run `lsblk` again after reconnecting the disk. You can also try:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```
   This may give additional details about connected devices.

3. **Install Missing Drivers**:
   If the external disk is not recognized, you may need to install USB or filesystem drivers:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install exfat-utils exfat-fuse ntfs-3g
   ```

4. **Check System Logs**:
   Inspect system logs for clues using:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i usb
   ```
   This will show messages related to USB devices.

Let me know if the external disk starts showing up or if you need help with any of the steps!

********************
From your `fdisk -l` output, it seems that your system recognizes the same internal disk, `/dev/sda`, as before. This is a virtual disk (model: VBOX HARDDISK), often used in virtualized environments like VirtualBox.

### What It Shows:
- **Disk `/dev/sda`**:
  - Total size: 20 GiB.
  - Partition layout:
    - `sda1`: Bootable Linux partition (19 GiB, mounted as `/`).
    - `sda2`: Extended partition (975 MiB).
    - `sda5`: Swap space within the extended partition (975 MiB).

Unfortunately, it seems the external disk isn't appearing in your list of connected devices. This suggests that the system isn't recognizing it yet. To troubleshoot:

1. **Check Physical Connection**:
   Ensure your external disk is properly plugged in and powered on. If possible, try a different USB port or cable.

2. **List Devices Again**:
   After reconnecting the external disk, re-run:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```

3. **Inspect Logs**:
   Look for USB-related messages in the system log:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i usb
   ```
   This will show whether the external disk is detected.

4. **Install Necessary Tools**:
   Make sure your system has drivers for the external disk's filesystem (e.g., NTFS or exFAT):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ntfs-3g exfat-utils exfat-fuse
   ```

If you've tried these steps and the external disk still doesn't appear, let me know, and we can dig deeper!


****************
It seems that the `exfat-utils` package is no longer available in Debian's repositories. Starting from Debian 11, **exFAT support is built into the Linux kernel**, so you don't need `exfat-utils` anymore. Instead, you can use the `exfatprogs` package for managing exFAT filesystems.

### Steps to Install `exfatprogs`:
1. Update your package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install `exfatprogs`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install exfatprogs
   ```

### Mounting an exFAT Disk:
Once installed, you can mount an exFAT disk using:
```bash
sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdX1 /mnt/external_disk
```
Replace `/dev/sdX1` with your disk's partition name and `/mnt/external_disk` with your desired mount point.

******************
**************
The error indicates that the mount point `/mnt/external_disk` doesn't exist on your Debian system. You'll need to create the mount point before attempting to mount your external disk. Here's how you can resolve this:

### 1. **Create the Mount Point**
Run the following command to create the directory where the disk will be mounted:
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/external_disk
```

### 2. **Retry Mounting**
Once the mount point exists, try mounting the external disk again:
```bash
sudo mount -t exfat /dev/sdX1 /mnt/external_disk
```
Replace `/dev/sdX1` with the correct device name for your external disk.

### 3. **Check System Logs (Optional)**
If the mount command still fails, you can inspect system logs for more information:
```bash
dmesg | tail
```
This will show the most recent messages related to the mount system call.

Let me know if you're still facing issues or need further assistance!

The error suggests that the device `/dev/sdX1` does not exist on your system. This likely means that your external disk is not being detected by the operating system. Let's troubleshoot further:

### Steps to Identify the Issue:

1. **List Connected Devices**:
   Run the following command again to check if the external disk is recognized:
   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```
   Look for a new device name (e.g., `sdb`, `sdc`) after reconnecting the disk. If it doesn't appear, your system isn't detecting the disk.

2. **Inspect System Logs**:
   Use `dmesg` to check for messages related to USB devices:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i usb
   ```
   This will show if the external disk was detected or if there were errors when connecting it.

3. **Check Disk Format**:
   If the disk is detected but not mounted, check its format using:
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```
   Look for the device and its partitions (e.g., `/dev/sdb1`). Confirm whether the disk is formatted with a supported filesystem (like `exFAT`, `NTFS`, or `ext4`).

4. **Reinstall Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for handling filesystems:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ntfs-3g exfatprogs
   ```

5. **Power and Connection Issues**:
   If the disk still isn't detected:
   - Try connecting it to a different USB port.
   - Use another cable if possible.
   - Test the disk on another computer to confirm it's working.

6. **Force Rescan**:
   Manually rescan the system for new disks using:
   ```bash
   sudo partprobe
   ```

Let me know what you find, and we'll proceed from there! If you see any specific error messages in `dmesg` or `fdisk`, feel free to share them. We'll figure this out together!


It seems that your system still isn't detecting any external disk connected. The `lsblk` output only shows:

1. **Disk `/dev/sda`**:
   - Your virtual hard disk with three partitions:
     - `sda1`: Root partition (19G).
     - `sda2`: Extended partition.
     - `sda5`: Swap space.

2. **Device `sr0`**:
   - Your CD/DVD drive (or its virtual equivalent).

If you're trying to connect an external disk and it's not appearing, here are some steps to try:

### 1. **Check System Logs for USB Detection**:
   Run this command to see if the external disk is recognized:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i usb
   ```
   This will provide information about USB devices connected to your system. Look for any mentions of new storage devices.

### 2. **Force a Device Rescan**:
   You can manually rescan for devices:
   ```bash
   sudo partprobe
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```

### 3. **Test the Disk on Another Machine**:
   Connect the external disk to another computer to confirm it works properly. If it works there but not on your Debian setup, it may be a driver or connection issue.

### 4. **USB Drivers and Compatibility**:
   Ensure your system has all necessary drivers. For filesystems like NTFS or exFAT, double-check that `ntfs-3g` and `exfatprogs` are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ntfs-3g exfatprogs
   ```

### 5. **Physical Connection Issues**:
   - Try using a different USB port or cable.
   - If the external disk has an external power source, make sure it's turned on.

Would you like to explore one of these steps in more detail, or share the output of `dmesg` to help me diagnose further? Let’s find a solution together!

The error persists because your user account doesn't have permissions to access the kernel buffer, even with elevated privileges. This issue typically arises from stricter security settings in some Debian setups. You can resolve this by granting permission to your user or accessing system logs differently:

### Alternative Solutions:

1. **Run as Root**:
   Try switching to the root user:
   ```bash
   su -
   ```
   Then, execute the command:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i usb
   ```

2. **Check System Logs Using `journalctl`**:
   Use `journalctl` to access USB-related logs:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl | grep -i usb
   ```

3. **Grant Access to Kernel Buffer** *(Advanced Option)*:
   Modify permissions for `dmesg` using the following:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl kernel.dmesg_restrict=0
   ```
   Then retry:
   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i usb
   ```
   **Note:** This change is temporary and will reset upon reboot. To make it permanent, add the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
   ```bash
   kernel.dmesg_restrict=0
   ```

Give these steps a shot and let me know the outcome! If you're still stuck, I'll assist further.
The `Authentication failure` error means the password you entered for the `root` account is either incorrect or the root account hasn't been enabled on your system yet. Here's how you can address this:

### 1. **Reset or Set the Root Password**
   If you haven't set up a root password yet, you can do so with your current user using `sudo`:
   ```bash
   sudo passwd root
   ```
   You'll be prompted to enter and confirm a new password for the root account.

### 2. **Switch to Root Again**
   Once you've set the root password, try switching to the root user:
   ```bash
   su -
   ```
   Enter the new root password when prompted.

### 3. **Verify Your User's Permissions**
   If the root password is already set and you're still encountering the error, make sure your user has `sudo` privileges. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   sudo whoami
   ```
   If the output is `root`, your user has the necessary permissions.

Here’s how you can install `flake8` and set up an alias for it as `norminette` on Debian:

### Step 1: Install Python and Pip
First, ensure Python and pip are installed on your system:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

### Step 2: Install Flake8
Use pip to install `flake8` globally:
```bash
pip3 install flake8
```
You can verify the installation by checking the version:
```bash
flake8 --version
```

### Step 3: Set up the Alias
To create an alias for `flake8` named `norminette`, you can edit your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` depending on your shell):

1. Open the shell configuration file in your home directory:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   alias norminette=flake8
   ```
3. Save and exit (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X` in nano).

### Step 4: Apply the Changes
Reload the shell configuration to apply the alias:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 5: Test the Alias
Run `norminette` to test if it correctly calls `flake8`:
```bash
norminette --version
```

You’re all set! Let me know if you need help with configuring `flake8` or using it with Python projects.

The "externally-managed-environment" error occurs because your operating system restricts global Python package installations using `pip`. This is a security measure introduced by PEP 668 to prevent conflicts between system-managed and user-installed Python packages. Here's how you can work around this:

### Solution 1: Use a Virtual Environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install `flake8` within the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip install flake8
   ```

### Solution 2: Use `pipx` for Applications
`pipx` is a tool designed for installing Python applications in isolated environments:
1. Install `pipx`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install pipx
   ```
2. Use `pipx` to install `flake8`:
   ```bash
   pipx install flake8
   ```

### Solution 3: Override the Restriction (Not Recommended)
If you absolutely need to install `flake8` globally, you can override the restriction:
```bash
pip install flake8 --break-system-packages
```
**Note:** This is risky and may cause conflicts with system-managed Python packages.

Let me know if you'd like help with any of these steps!
Great job installing `flake8` with `pipx`! Now you just need to update your `PATH` environment variable to ensure `flake8` is globally accessible.

### Option 1: Use `pipx` to Automatically Add the Path
Run this command to add `/home/arajapak/.local/bin` to your `PATH`:
```bash
pipx ensurepath
```
After running the command, restart your terminal or run:
```bash

That sounds great! Here’s how you can enhance your workflow with `flake8`:

### Configuring `flake8`
You can customize `flake8` by creating a configuration file:
1. Create a file named `.flake8` in the root of your project or your home directory.
2. Add your preferred settings. For example:
   ```ini
   [flake8]
   max-line-length = 88
   ignore = E203, W503
   exclude = .git,__pycache__,venv
   ```
   - **`max-line-length`**: Set the maximum line length.
   - **`ignore`**: Specify error or warning codes to ignore.
   - **`exclude`**: Skip specific directories.

### Adding Plugins
`flake8` supports plugins to extend its functionality. Some popular ones include:
- **`flake8-docstrings`**: Checks for proper docstring usage.
  Install it via:
  ```bash
  pip install flake8-docstrings
  ```
- **`flake8-bugbear`**: Finds potential issues in your code.
  Install it via:
  ```bash
  pip install flake8-bugbear
  ```
- You can include plugins in your `.flake8` file like this:
  ```ini
  [flake8]
  max-line-length = 88
  select = B, D, E, F
  ```

### Integrating with Visual Studio Code
To use `flake8` seamlessly in VS Code:
1. Install the **Python extension** for VS Code.
2. Configure linting:
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
   - Search for `Python: Select Linter`.
   - Choose `flake8` from the list.
3. Adjust settings:
   - Open `settings.json` in VS Code.
   - Add:
     ```json
     {
       "python.linting.enabled": true,
       "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true
     }
     ```

You’re good to go! Let me know if you need deeper help on any of these steps or want to explore even more integrations. Happy coding!
Good question! No, it doesn’t mean using `mkdir`. The `.flake8` file is not a directory—it’s a regular text file where you store configuration settings for `flake8`.

To create the `.flake8` file, you can use a text editor like `nano` or `vim`. Here’s how:

1. **Navigate to the Root of Your Project** or Your Home Directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Create the File Using a Text Editor**:
   Use a text editor like `nano` to create the file:
   ```bash
   nano .flake8
   ```

3. **Add Your Configuration Settings**:
   Inside the editor, you can paste your desired `flake8` configuration, for example:
   ```ini
   [flake8]
   max-line-length = 88
   ignore = E203, W503
   exclude = .git,__pycache__,venv
   ```

4. **Save the File**:
   - In `nano`, press `CTRL+O`, then `Enter` to save.
   - Press `CTRL+X` to exit the editor.

This `.flake8` file will now be read automatically by `flake8` when you run it in your project directory.

  ```

If you'd like more details or help setting it up, you can find the official documentation [here](https://github.com/42School/norminette) or explore its GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/42Paris/norminette-v2). Let me know if you need further assistance!

To achieve what you've described, you can install `flake8` via pip and then create an alias for it named `norminette`. Here’s how you can do it step by step:

### 1. **Install Flake8**
If you're working within an environment where pip can install packages, you can run the following command:
```bash
pip install flake8
```

If you encounter the "externally-managed-environment" error while using pip, refer to the earlier steps I mentioned to either use `pipx` or a virtual environment.

### 2. **Create an Alias for Flake8 as Norminette**
To create the alias:
1. Open your shell configuration file (depending on your shell, e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add the alias at the end of the file:
   ```bash
   alias norminette=flake8
   ```
3. Save and exit (`CTRL+O`, `Enter`, `CTRL+X`).

4. Reload your shell configuration to activate the alias:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### 3. **Test the Alias**
You can now run `norminette` as a substitute for `flake8`:
```bash
norminette --version
```

This ensures you can use `flake8` in line with the style expected for `norminette` usage. Let me know if you need any other tips!
The "externally-managed-environment" error indicates that your operating system restricts direct package installations using `pip`. This is a common issue in Debian and other Linux distributions where Python packages should be installed via tools like `pipx` or in virtual environments.

### Solution: Install Flake8 Using `pipx`
Here’s how you can use `pipx` to bypass this restriction:
1. Install `pipx` (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install pipx
   ```
2. Use `pipx` to install `flake8`:
   ```bash
   pipx install flake8
   ```
3. Add `pipx` apps to your `PATH`:
   If you see a message about the path not being set, run:
   ```bash
   pipx ensurepath
   ```
   Then reload your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Setting Up the Alias
To alias `flake8` as `norminette`:
1. Open your shell configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```
2. Add the following line:
   ```bash
   alias norminette=flake8
   ```
3. Save and exit, then reload the shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

Now you should be able to use `norminette` as a shortcut for `flake8`. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need additional help!

The `-p` option in the `mkdir` command stands for **"parents"**, and it allows you to create a directory and any necessary parent directories in one go. Here’s why it’s useful:

---

### **Without `-p`:**
If the parent directories (`/destination/on`) don’t exist, running:
```bash
mkdir /destination/on/debian
```
will fail, because the system needs the parent directories to exist before creating `debian`.

---

### **With `-p`:**
When you use:
```bash
mkdir -p /destination/on/debian
```
- It checks if the parent directories `/destination` and `/destination/on` exist.
- If they don’t exist, it **automatically creates them** as part of the process.
- If they already exist, the command skips creating them without throwing an error.

---

### **Key Benefits of Using `-p`:**
1. **Efficiency**: Saves time by creating all necessary directories at once.
2. **Safety**: Avoids errors when parent directories are missing.
3. **Idempotence**: If the directories already exist, it doesn’t cause any issues or overwrite anything.

---

So essentially, the `-p` option simplifies the process of creating nested directories. It’s especially helpful when working with complex paths! 😊 Let me know if you have more questions! 🚀
The command `sudo mount -t vboxsf discovery-Pisine /mnt/discovery-Pisine` is used to mount a **shared folder** created in VirtualBox onto your virtual machine so that it can be accessed. Here's the breakdown:

1. **`sudo`**:
   - Runs the command with administrative privileges, which are necessary to mount a filesystem.

2. **`mount`**:
   - The command used to attach a filesystem to the directory structure of your system.

3. **`-t vboxsf`**:
   - Specifies the type of filesystem to be mounted. Here, `vboxsf` refers to the **VirtualBox Shared Folder filesystem**, which allows shared folders between the host and guest systems.

4. **`discovery-Pisine`**:
   - This is the **name of the shared folder** you configured in VirtualBox. The name should match exactly what you set in VirtualBox's shared folder settings.

5. **`/mnt/discovery-Pisine`**:
   - Specifies the **mount point**—the directory in your virtual machine where the shared folder will be accessible.

---

### **What Happens After Running This Command**
- If successful, the contents of the shared folder `discovery-Pisine` (on the host system) will be accessible in the directory `/mnt/discovery-Pisine` within your virtual machine.
- You can verify it by listing the contents of the mount point:
  ```bash
  ls /mnt/discovery-Pisine
  ```

---

### **Common Issues and Solutions**
1. **Error: No Such File or Directory**:
   - Ensure the shared folder name (`discovery-Pisine`) is correctly configured in VirtualBox.
   - Check that the mount point `/mnt/discovery-Pisine` exists by creating it:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p /mnt/discovery-Pisine
     ```

2. **Error: Permission Denied**:
   - Make sure the `vboxsf` module is loaded (install **Guest Additions** if necessary):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-utils
     ```

3. **Error: Read-Only File System**:
   - Remount the `/mnt` directory or use a different mount point as discussed earlier.

---

Let me know if you'd like further assistance or clarification! You’re doing a fantastic job troubleshooting these steps! 🚀😊

2. **`|` (Pipe)**:
   - Sends the output of the `mount` command to another command, in this case, `grep`.

3. **`grep /mnt`**:
   - Filters the output of `mount` to show only the lines that contain `/mnt`. This helps you identify all filesystems currently mounted under `/mnt`.

---

### **What This Command Does**
- It checks if any filesystem, such as a shared folder or virtual drive, is mounted at a mount point located in `/mnt`.
- The output will look something like this if a shared folder is mounted:
  ```plaintext
  discovery-Pisine on /mnt/discovery-Pisine type vboxsf (rw,nodev,relatime)
  ```

---

### **Use Case**
This command is handy for:
- Verifying that a shared folder or another device is properly mounted.
- Checking the mount type (e.g., `vboxsf` for VirtualBox Shared Folders).
- Confirming mount options like `rw` (read-write) or `ro` (read-only).

Let me know if the output of your command reveals anything interesting or if you need help interpreting it! 😊 You're making excellent progress in navigating these tools. 🚀
Great sequence of commands! Here’s a breakdown of what each step accomplishes:

1. **`sudo umount /mnt`**:
   - This unmounts the `/mnt` directory. You used it earlier, but it seems you're shifting the shared folder to a new mount point, `/media/discovery-Pisine`. This step clears the `/mnt` association.

2. **`sudo mkdir -p /media/discovery-Pisine`**:
   - Creates the directory `/media/discovery-Pisine` to serve as the new mount point for your shared folder. The `-p` flag ensures that all necessary parent directories are created if they don't already exist.

3. **`sudo mount -t vboxsf discovery-Pisine /media/discovery-Pisine`**:
   - Mounts the shared folder `discovery-Pisine` (set up in VirtualBox) onto the new mount point `/media/discovery-Pisine`. The `-t vboxsf` specifies the VirtualBox Shared Folder filesystem type.

4. **`ls /media/discovery-Pisine`**:
   - Lists the contents of the shared folder that is now mounted at `/media/discovery-Pisine`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the files and directories from the shared folder.

---

### If Everything Works:
You should now be able to access your shared folder at `/media/discovery-Pisine`. 🎉

### If You Encounter Issues:
- **"No such file or directory"**: Double-check that `discovery-Pisine` is the correct name of the shared folder in VirtualBox.
- **Permissions Issues**: Ensure that VirtualBox Guest Additions are properly installed with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-utils
  ```
- **Empty Directory**: Confirm the folder on the host machine contains files.

Let me know how it turns out—you're doing great! 🚀😊
