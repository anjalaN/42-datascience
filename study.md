No problem! Let me break it down for you. üòä  

### **üîç Web Scraping (Scraping Web Data)**
**Definition:**  
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated tools. This is useful when you need to collect structured information from different sources (e.g., prices from e-commerce sites, news articles, financial data).

**Example:**  
Imagine you want to get the latest stock prices from a website:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
piscineds-# 


url = "https://example.com/stocks"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

prices = soup.find_all("span", class_="stock-price")
for price in prices:
    print(price.text)
```
This script **fetches the web page** and **extracts stock prices** using `BeautifulSoup`.

### **üîπ What is an ETL Pipeline?**
**ETL stands for**: **Extract, Transform, Load**  
It's a process used in **Data Engineering** to gather data, clean it, and store it in a database.

**Steps:**
1. **Extract** ‚Üí Get raw data (from databases, APIs, web scraping).
2. **Transform** ‚Üí Clean, filter, and structure the data.
3. **Load** ‚Üí Store processed data in a database.

**Example ETL Pipeline with Python**
```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Data (Web Scraping or API)
data = {"name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "age": [25, 30]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Transform Data (Clean & Format)
df["age"] = df["age"].astype(int)

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Load Data (Save to Database)
conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
df.to_sql("users", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)
conn.close()

print("ETL Process Completed!")
```
This code takes **data**, cleans it, and **stores it in an SQLite database**.
