****instalation crul with debian ****

It looks like the `curl` command isn't installed on your system, which is causing your script to fail. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Install `curl`
On most systems, you can install `curl` with a simple package manager command. Here's what you should use depending on your operating system:
- **Debian/Ubuntu** (and similar Linux distros):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install curl
  ```
- **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL**:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install curl
  ```
- **macOS** (if using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install curl
  ```
- **Windows**:
  Install curl via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or ensure it is added to your PATH.

### Step 2: Verify Installation
Once installed, check if `curl` works:
```bash
curl --version
```
If you see version information, you're good to go!

### Step 3: Re-run Your Script
Execute your script again after installing `curl`. Hopefully, this resolves the issue!

This snippet does not directly use **getter and setter methods**, but it leverages Python's built-in `getattr()` function. Let me explain what `getattr()` does and why it's used here. I'll also touch on getter and setter concepts for comparison.

### **About `getattr()` in Python**
`getattr()` is a built-in Python function that retrieves the value of an attribute from an object dynamically. Here's its syntax:
```python
getattr(object, attribute_name, default_value)
```
- **`object`**: The object you want to inspect (in this case, `settings`).
- **`attribute_name`**: The name of the attribute you want to access as a string (e.g., `"name"`, `"surname"`).
- **`default_value`** (optional): A fallback value if the attribute doesn't exist in the object.

In your script:
```python
getattr(settings, "name", "Unknown")
```
- If the `name` attribute exists in the `settings` object, its value is returned.
- If it doesnâ€™t exist, the default value `"Unknown"` is returned instead.

This mechanism prevents the program from crashing when an attribute is missing. Itâ€™s a graceful way to handle errors dynamically.

---

### **How Does `getattr()` Differ from Getter Methods?**
- A **getter method** is explicitly defined within a class to retrieve the value of an attribute.
- Itâ€™s part of a larger convention called encapsulation, where class attributes are kept private, and access is controlled through specific methods.

For example:
```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self):
        self._name = "duoquadragintian"
    
    # Getter method
    def get_name(self):
        return self._name
```
Using this approach:
```python
settings = Settings()
print(settings.get_name())  # Output: "duoquadragintian"
```

In contrast, `getattr()` dynamically fetches attributes from an object without requiring explicit getter methods.

---

### **Why Use `getattr()` in This Context?**
The dynamic nature of `getattr()` is perfect for your script because:
1. **No Explicit Class Methods**: `settings.py` is a simple Python file containing variables, not a class with getter methods.
2. **Dynamic Default Values**: If a variable like `surname` or `title` is missing in `settings.py`, `getattr()` assigns `"Unknown"` without raising an error.
3. **Flexibility**: It reduces hardcoding and lets your script adapt to various versions of `settings.py`.

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature            | Getter Method                      | `getattr()`                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Explicit method in a class         | Built-in function               |
| **Use Case**        | Accessing private class attributes | Dynamically accessing attributes|
| **Default Values**  | Requires manual handling           | Can provide defaults easily     |
| **Flexibility**     | Limited to predefined methods      | Dynamic and versatile           |
